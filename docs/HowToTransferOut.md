# How to transfer out

Transfering ether to a different address is currently not possible within the application.
However since the keystore is on device, it's possible to access it to withdraw coins.

You can connect your computer to your mobile device and copy over the keystore folder.
Or you can also do it from you mobile phone with any [file manager](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=file) and go to the keystore folder.
If you don't know where you keystore folder is, check from the EtherollApp.
Open the side bar, go to "Wallet" then "Import". The keystore folder location is listed here.
It's usually `/sdcard/etheroll/.config/pyethapp/keystore/`

Then you can use that keystore file with any wallet such as [MEW](https://www.myetherwallet.com) or [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com).
